# Games-Reimagined

  The game i decided to recreate was Pac-man which is one of the oldest arcade games but also is one of the most iconic and well known ones, it was enjoyable to recreate a nostalgic game such as this and some aspects posed as a challenge but throught a lot of effort and time and research i was able to pull it off, my design process went about first solidifying the ideas i had in my mind i decided to create 4 levels though the game can be somewhat diffuicult to even reach those levels, i also decided to make the pac-man a square shape instead of its ussual circular shape to make it clearer and easier to go through the paths, and the levels designs themselves were similar the the original game so they werent difficult to recreate, i didnt create any modern twists the game because originally the game in nature is very simple and i couldnt think of anything modern to add to it that wouldnt change the game drastically.
